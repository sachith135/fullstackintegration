Blazor UI and .Net Core Integration
ðŸš€ InventoryHub Pro - Reflective Summary on Microsoft Copilot Usage
During the development of InventoryHub Pro, Microsoft Copilot played a crucial role in enhancing efficiency, debugging integration issues, and optimizing performance. Below is a brief summary of how Copilot contributed to various stages of the project:

Generating & Refining Integration Code:

Copilot assisted in writing Blazor WebAssembly service methods to interact with the .NET Minimal API.
It helped structure CRUD API endpoints with best practices, including error handling and response validation.
Debugging and Resolving Integration Issues:

When Blazor UI wasn't displaying fetched data, Copilot suggested debugging steps using Console.WriteLine() to trace API responses.
It identified CORS issues and suggested the proper CORS policy configuration in Program.cs.
Creating and Implementing JSON Structures:

Copilot ensured that data models matched between Blazor and the API, preventing serialization errors.
It provided optimized JSON response formatting to align API responses with front-end expectations.
Optimizing Performance for Integration Code:

Suggested using AsNoTracking() in database queries to improve API response time.
Recommended lazy loading for Blazor UI to avoid unnecessary API calls, enhancing app performance.
Project Documentation and Code Structuring:

Assisted in writing clean, well-documented code with inline comments.
Provided structured GitHub README.md templates for clarity in project documentation.
By leveraging Microsoft Copilot, I was able to significantly reduce development time, identify and fix integration issues quickly, and implement optimized, structured code for seamless full-stack communication. The AI-powered assistance streamlined the entire development workflow, making InventoryHub Pro a scalable and efficient inventory management solution.
